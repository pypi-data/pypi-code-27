"""
Supports the soft assert style of testing, 
where multiple assertions can fail within the same method, 
while collecting and formatting those failures' stack traces
for reporting by a final assert_all call.

@usage:	
	import softest

	class ExampleTest(softest.TestCase):
		def test_example(self):
			self.soft_assert(self.assertEqual, 'Worf', 'wharf', 'Klingon is not ship receptacle')
			self.soft_assert(self.assertTrue, True)
			self.soft_assert(self.assertTrue, False)
			
			self.assert_all()
			
	if __name__ == '__main__':
		softest.main()
			

@etymology:
	'softest' stems from 'soft-test',
	joined because twin consonants split like this are terrible to the tongue,
	and especially because "softest" sounds pleasant,
	like warm bath towels on one's face =)

        This is a more general version of the 'histogram' method. Instead of
        only counting how often results occurred for one specific measurement,
        this method tensors multiple measurement results together and counts
        how often the combined results occurred.

        For example, suppose that:

            - fold_func is not specified
            - keys=['abc', 'd']
            - the measurement with key 'abc' measures qubits a, b, and c.
            - the measurement with key 'd' measures qubit d.
            - the circuit was sampled 3 times.
            - the sampled measurement values were:
                1. a=1 b=0 c=0 d=0
                2. a=0 b=1 c=0 d=1
                3. a=1 b=0 c=0 d=0

        Then the counter returned by this method will be:

                (0b010, 1): 1
            })


        Where '0b100' is binary for '4' and '0b010' is binary for '2'. Notice
        that the bits are combined in a big-endian way by default, with the
        first measured qubit determining the highest-value bit.

        Args:
            fold_func: A function used to convert sampled measurement results
                into countable values. The input is a tuple containing the
                list of bits measured by each measurement specified by the

                to returning tuples of integers, where each integer is the big
                endian interpretation of the bits a measurement sampled.
            keys: Keys of measurements to include in the histogram.

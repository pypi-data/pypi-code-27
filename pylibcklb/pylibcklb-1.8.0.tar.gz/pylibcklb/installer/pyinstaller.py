## Documentation for a method to build the executable with pyinstaller
# Write the following code to some python script in the top directory and call it then from windows command line:
# @code
#from pylibcklb.installer.pyinstaller import build
#
#if __name__ == "__main__":
#    name    = 'Example Program'
#    version = '1.0.0' 
#    build(name, version)
# @endcode
#   @param programm_name The name of the program
#   @param version_number The version of the program
def build(programm_name, version_number):
    if platform.system() == 'Windows':
        BuildOnWindows(programm_name, version_number)
    else:
        BuildOnLinux(programm_name, version_number)
